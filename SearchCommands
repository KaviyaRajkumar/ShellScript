1. Basic Search in Current Directory and Subdirectories
   grep -r "search_term"

2. Search in a Specific Directory
   grep -r "search_term" /path/to/directory

3. Display Only Filenames Containing the Search Term
   grep -rl "search_term"
   The -l option tells grep to display only the names of files containing the search term.

4. Case-Insensitive Search
   grep -ri "search_term"
   The -i option makes the search case-insensitive, so it will match "search_term", "Search_Term", "SEARCH_TERM", etc.

5. Search Within Specific File Types
   grep -r --include="*.txt" "search_term"
   This command searches for "search_term" only in files with the .txt extension.

6. Exclude Specific Files or Directories
   grep -r --exclude="*.bak" "search_term"
   This command excludes files with the .bak extension from the search. To exclude entire directories, use:

7. Search for Whole Words Only
   grep -rw "search_term" .
   The -w option ensures that grep matches only whole words, so it won't match partial words.

8. Show Line Numbers with Matches
    grep -rn "search_term" .
    The -n option shows the line numbers where the search term appears.

9. Use ripgrep for Faster Searches
   rg "search_term" 
   If you have ripgrep (often installed as rg) available, it's a faster alternative to grep for recursive searches:
